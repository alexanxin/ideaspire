# Ideaspire "Idea Shares": Tokenomics & Utility Blueprint

This document outlines the economic model, distribution, and utility for "Idea Shares," the unique fungible tokens that power the Ideaspire Launchpad ecosystem.

## 1. The Core Concept

"Idea Shares" are the mechanism through which the community can fund new ventures and share in their potential success.

*   **What They Are:** Fungible tokens created for a *specific* minted idea. Each project has its own unique shares (e.g., an "AI Chef" idea would have `CHEF` shares). They represent a Backer's contribution and early belief in a project.

*   **What They Are Not:** Idea Shares are **not** traditional equity or stock. They are a new class of digital asset whose value is derived from the utility and promises defined by the Founder and the Ideaspire platform.

## 2. The Tokenomics: A Simple & Transparent Model

To ensure clarity and trust, all projects launched on Ideaspire will follow a standardized tokenomics model.

### 2.1. Creation & Supply

*   **Creation Event:** Idea Shares are created the moment a Founder lists their minted idea on the Launchpad.
*   **Total Supply:** A **fixed total supply of 1,000,000 Idea Shares** is created for each project. This fixed supply ensures predictability and prevents inflation.

### 2.2. Distribution Model

The 1,000,000 shares are allocated as follows to align the incentives of all parties:

*   **Community Backers (50% - 500,000 shares):**
    *   This portion is reserved for the community fundraising pool.
    *   The price is fixed and simple: **1 USDC = 1 Idea Share**.
    *   If a Founder's funding goal is 10,000 USDC, a maximum of 10,000 shares from this pool will be distributed to Backers. Unused shares are held in the project's treasury for future funding rounds or other incentives.

*   **The Founder (25% - 250,000 shares):**
    *   This is the Founder's personal stake, rewarding them for their vision, execution, and future work. This allocation is locked until the initial funding goal is met.

*   **Ideaspire Platform (5% - 50,000 shares):**
    *   This allocation goes to the Ideaspire treasury, giving the platform "skin in the game." Our success is directly tied to the success of the ventures we help launch.

*   **Community Treasury (20% - 200,000 shares):**
    *   These shares are held in a project-specific treasury, initially controlled by the Founder. They are intended for future growth and can be used for:
        *   Rewarding key community members.
        *   Funding development bounties.
        *   Airdropping to early product users to bootstrap a network.

## 3. The Utility: The Value Proposition for Backers

The primary driver of value for Idea Shares is the utility they provide to holders. When listing their project, Founders can commit to offering a combination of the following benefits:

### 3.1. The Ultimate Upside: The Airdrop

*   This is the core economic incentive. If a project succeeds and launches its own official token (e.g., a governance or utility token for their product), Founders can **airdrop** a portion of this new, potentially more valuable token directly to their Idea Share holders.
*   Idea Shares effectively become a **"golden ticket"** for early access to a future, liquid asset.

### 3.2. Exclusive Access & Perks

*   **Beta Access:** Idea Share holders get to be the first to use the product, provide feedback, and shape its development.
*   **Product Discounts:** Holders can be granted a lifetime discount on the product or service.
*   **Private Community:** Access to a token-gated Discord channel or forum for direct communication with the Founder and other early backers.

### 3.3. Governance & Influence

*   Idea Shares can be used to grant voting rights on key early-stage decisions, making Backers feel like true partners in the venture.
*   Examples: "Which feature should we build next?" or "What should our branding look like?"

### 3.4. Potential Revenue Share

*   For the most ambitious projects, a Founder could commit to sharing a small percentage of the project's future revenue with Idea Share holders, providing a direct and long-term reward for their early belief.
