## Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Business ideas table
CREATE TABLE business_ideas (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(100),
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Categories table (optional)
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_business_ideas_date ON business_ideas(date);
CREATE INDEX idx_business_ideas_category ON business_ideas(category);
```

## Gemini API Integration

- **Purpose**: Research latest business trends and generate creative ideas by analyzing various sources
- **Current Sources**:
  - Twitter trends and discussions
  - Latest business and tech news
  - Reddit communities for user pain points and needs
- **Reddit Integration**:
  - Searches Reddit posts for patterns like "I need a tool for..." or similar user needs
  - Analyzes r/startups, r/entrepreneurship, r/smallbusiness, and other related subreddits
  - Extracts user pain points and tool gaps to generate targeted business ideas
  - Uses Reddit API to gather recent posts and comments
- **Functionality**:
  - Daily research prompts
  - Multi-source research aggregation
  - Idea generation based on current trends and user needs
  - Formatting ideas as detailed prompts
- **Implementation**: Server-side API calls to prevent exposing API keys, with aggregated research from Twitter, news, and Reddit APIs

## Reddit API Integration

### Overview

The application leverages Reddit's search and data APIs to identify unmet user needs and potential business opportunities. This provides a bottom-up approach to idea generation by analyzing what real users are asking for in various communities.

### Implementation Details

- **Reddit Search Patterns**: Scans for specific phrases indicating tool or service needs:
  - "I need a tool for..."
  - "Looking for something that can..."
  - "Is there software that..."
  - "I wish there was an app to..."
- **Target Subreddits**:
  - r/startups
  - r/entrepreneurship
  - r/smallbusiness
  - r/SaaS
  - r/Productivity
  - r/freelance
  - r/consulting
- **Data Collection**:
  - Recent posts (last 7-30 days depending on frequency)
  - Top comments on relevant posts
  - Filtering for quality and relevance
- **API Endpoints Used**:
  - Reddit Search API
  - Post and Comment APIs
  - Subreddit data endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Reddit's API rate limits and implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Data Processing**: Uses Gemini to analyze and categorize the collected Reddit data before idea generation

### Security & Compliance

- Respects Reddit's robots.txt and API terms of service
- No user data is stored locally
- Uses official Reddit API endpoints
- Implements proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
