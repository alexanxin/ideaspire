# Tier Logic Implementation - Remaining Tasks

_Date: 2025-09-29_

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining tasks for completing the tier logic implementation in the SpinToWin application. The core tier system has been implemented, but several production-ready features and improvements are still needed.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**

- Tier definitions and pricing structure
- Backend API routes for subscriptions and limits
- Database schema updates
- Frontend UI components and integration
- Basic tier enforcement and limits
- Pricing page with modern design
- User interaction tracking

## Remaining Tasks

### **Immediate Priority**

- [ ] **Test full tier logic integration end-to-end**

  - Verify complete user flow from signup to limit enforcement
  - Test all tier transitions and limit calculations
  - Validate boost period logic for Basic tier

- [ ] **Implement daily limit resets**
  - Add cron job or scheduled function for midnight UTC resets
  - Ensure resets happen consistently across time zones
  - Handle edge cases around daylight saving time

### **User Experience**

- [ ] **Add user onboarding flow for new users**

  - Guide users through tier selection during signup
  - Explain tier benefits and differences
  - Implement freemium conversion prompts

- [ ] **Implement proper error handling for API failures**

  - Graceful handling of network failures
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Retry mechanisms for failed requests

- [ ] **Add loading states for limit updates**

  - Show loading indicators during tier upgrades
  - Display progress for limit refreshes
  - Prevent multiple simultaneous upgrade attempts

- [ ] **Add notification system for limit warnings**
  - Alert users when approaching daily limits
  - Show remaining actions available
  - Suggest tier upgrades when limits are reached

### **Business Logic**

- [ ] **Implement tier downgrade logic**

  - Handle subscription cancellations gracefully
  - Prorate refunds for downgrades
  - Maintain data access for paid features

- [ ] **Test upgrade flow with real payment integration**

  - Replace mock system with Stripe/PayPal integration
  - Implement webhook handling for payment confirmations
  - Add payment method management

- [ ] **Add analytics tracking for tier usage**
  - Monitor conversion rates between tiers
  - Track feature usage by tier
  - Generate revenue and engagement reports

### **Technical Improvements**

- [ ] **Add rate limiting for API endpoints**

  - Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage
  - Implement different limits for different tiers
  - Add request queuing for high-traffic periods

- [ ] **Add unit tests for tier logic functions**

  - Test limit calculations and edge cases
  - Validate boost period logic
  - Ensure API responses are correct

- [ ] **Implement data migration for existing users**

  - Handle users who were on the old system
  - Preserve existing data and preferences
  - Communicate changes clearly

- [ ] **Test mobile responsiveness**

  - Ensure pricing page works on all screen sizes
  - Verify header layout on mobile devices
  - Test touch interactions for limit displays

- [ ] **Test performance with high user load**
  - Load testing for concurrent users
  - Database query optimization
  - CDN setup for static assets

### **Administrative**

- [ ] **Add admin panel for tier management**

  - Interface for viewing user tiers and limits
  - Manual tier adjustments and overrides
  - Usage analytics dashboard

- [ ] **Update documentation**
  - API documentation for new endpoints
  - User guide for tier system
  - Developer documentation for tier logic

## Implementation Notes

### **Priority Order**

1. End-to-end testing (critical for launch)
2. Daily resets (required for functionality)
3. Error handling and loading states (user experience)
4. Payment integration (revenue generation)
5. Admin tools and analytics (business operations)

### **Dependencies**

- Daily reset functionality depends on server environment (cron jobs)
- Payment integration requires third-party service setup
- Admin panel needs authentication and authorization
- Analytics requires data collection infrastructure

### **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] User registration and default tier assignment
- [ ] Tier upgrade/downgrade flows
- [ ] Daily limit enforcement and resets
- [ ] Boost period calculations
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Performance under load

## Next Steps

1. Begin with end-to-end testing of current implementation
2. Implement daily limit resets
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Integrate real payment processing
5. Build admin and analytics tools
